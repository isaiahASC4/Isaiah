    <p>Chance grew up in West Chatham on Chicago's South Side. Chance's father was an aide to former Chicago mayor Harold Washington, and worked for Senator Barack Obama. For much of his young life his father hoped that Chance would one day hold office. Chance attended Jones College Prep High School, and many of his teachers ridiculed his aspirations to become a musician.</p>
